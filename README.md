# Benchmarking Simulated Robotic Manipulation through a Real World Dataset

We  present  a  benchmark  to  facilitate  simulated manipulation; an attempt to overcome the obstacles of physical benchmarks  through  the  distribution  of  a  real  world,  groundtruth  dataset.  Users  are  given  various  simulated  manipulationtasks with assigned protocols having the objective of replicatingthe  real  world  results  of  a  recorded  dataset

## Installation

This code was developed with Python 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04.

V-REP: Version 3.5.0*

PyBullet: Version 2.1.1

*Please add vrep.py, vrepConst.py and remoteApi.so files relevant for your distribution of V-Rep to the Software directory.

## Packages Overview

* `kinova_description`: Contains external dependencies required to run the simulation including mesh files and the URDF of the robot arm.
* `Results`: Contains the mean results from the dataset and is where the results from the simulations will be saved.
* `BenchmarkingMetrics`: Folder containing the python script to run the benchmarking metrics.
* `main.py`: Must have the filepath for Vrep dependancies updated by the user. 
* `kinova_vr.py`: VRep simulation class.
* `kinova_pb.py`: PyBullet simulation class.
* `PID.py`: Used as the proportional controller.
* `Rotations.py`: Generated target thetas based upon current time step.

## Running

To execute run main.py

## Results and Metrics

The results from execution main.py will be saved in the Results directory. The results are in the form of .csv files. Use the performance_metrics.py script in the BenchmarkingMetrics folder to calculate the metrics for submission in the website.
